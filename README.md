# 🌍 Know Your Emission

A sustainability-driven platform that helps users understand the environmental impact of their personal devices.

---

## 📘 Overview

Know Your Emission is an educational web project where users can select a device (smartphone, laptop, etc.) and instantly see:

- 📦 Manufacturing CO₂ emissions
- 🔋 Recycled materials used
- 🌫️ Lifecycle environmental impact
- 🌱 Eco-friendly alternatives and sustainable measures

All numbers come from a life cycle assessment (LCA) reports, which are made to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product, service, or process across its entire life cycle. Also, we use the official companies’ reports, such as Product Environment Reports (PER) made by Apple.

This project supports UN SDGs:

- SDG 12 — Responsible Consumption & Production
- SDG 9 — Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure
- SDG 7 — Affordable and Clean Energy
